Learning: Hashmap and Graph (undirected)

The overall approach I achieved was marked the visited node by adding to the new hashmap as a value, and current node as a key. (currNode, newNode)
if (newHashMap.containsKey(currNode)) {
    return newHashMap.get(currNode); // to get the corresponding node which is newNode
}
Add the newNode into the newHashMap
For loop to loop all the arraylist, and recursive call.
for ... {
    newNode.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(neighbor)); // this is the recursive call;
}
